# these is a very simple script for building an ids consisting of Suricata、Barnyard2 and Snorby.
# as is known, the snorby is the main manager which demonstrates the results collecting from the Suricata
# the Suricata is used to analyse the traffic and Barnyard2 helps it to convert its format and write the data to mysql database
# the the snorby would get data from mysql
# the stop.sh is about to stop  Suricata、Barnyard2 and Snorby at once
#the start.sh is about to stop  Suricata、Barnyard2 and Snorby at once
# the setup.sh is about to build Suricata、Barnyard2 and Snorby automate automatically. 
# since this script is so simple. there are some errors while building, therefore you will need to run the command in the cscript one by one.
# maybe you can improve my script for building Suricata、Barnyard2 and Snorby at once
# please help me to make the script more convenient and robotics.
